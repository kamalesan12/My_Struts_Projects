Project Overview: Handling Arithmetic Exceptions
Introduction :

Here in this project i have coded how to handle the Arithmatic Exceptions  for that we should be knowing what is exception first and then what is the Arithmatic Exception next 
and what are all the possible ways to handle it 

1.Let's make a scenario if a fine number divided with a finite number then it would results in positive result if it is negative then in negative result what if we divide the number with Zero 

This is what would cause the Arithmatic Exception we cant divide a number with Zero 

so, in order to handle this kind of Exception with User Defined Exception despite forwarding it to the Internal Server Error 500 we can show Jsp page with a smily image or a text indicating that a 
user can not do that Kind of operations 

Summary
This project aims to provide a robust method for managing Arithmetic Exceptions, ensuring a better user experience while maintaining program integrity.
